I want to make sure you fully understand the three options for your site moving forward.

1) Stay with Drupal 7. With this option, you'll stay at the same base hosting price but pay additional amounts for management and updates. Instead of sending you an email every few years that the site needs updating, we will be performing updates more regularly and adding it to your monthly or annual bill. 

So the price for hosting is $75/year and $90/year for Drupal updates, plus the domain name is $13 a year. The maintenance price is based on the current cost to update your site split over three years. That's a total of $178/year. If you wish to stick with Drupal, we will do our best to make the theme match what it was. It will probably take several weeks to do so.

2) A completely static website. You'll have access to your site in the form of HTML files, and can edit the HTML with an editor like iWeb or DreamWeaver. This will be updated by you, and uploaded using Dropbox (https://www.dropbox.com/) or GitHub (https://github.com/). The price for this is $60 per year, and includes hosting and 1 domain.

3) Static CMS. Our newest offering includes a static website featuring a clear separation of presentation and content. This allows for super easy content changes. Here you'll manage your content as plain text files, and various online and desktop tools exist for editing these files. The price is $120 per year, and includes hosting, domain name, and the ability to sync files on your computer (and elsewhere) with the website for updating content.

You are in a unique situation where we've actually built out all three options for you so we can move forward with whatever you decide. Based on what we know of your site, we highly recommend option 3, but will provide whichever you choose.

Since the third option is still a new option for us, I suspect there may be some questions. I'll be happy to add more information as needed, and we'll do our best to help make your decision the best option for your website in the long term.
