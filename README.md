## Website Options

To over simplify, websites can be created and maintained in one of two ways.

1. They are completely **static HTML** files. Using a tool or manually creating HTML is required. Presentation and content is tightly coupled.
2. Using a Content Management System (**CMS**) that separates content from presentation. Drupal is an example of a CMS.

On the surface it would appear the cost of hosting Static HTML based sites is fairly close to the cost to host a CMS site. So why not use a CMS?

Let's first look at what is included for each option.

### Static Sites

We charge $60/yr for static site hosting that includes the following:

* Domain name registration.
* World leading DNS hosting. Same stuff used by Amazon and Twitter.
* Infinite file versioning. Recover any version of any file.
* Content Delivery Network (CDN) for super fast asset delivery.
* Dropbox integration for easier than FTP management of files.

No server side (PHP) scripts are allowed. Our Static Site infrastructure is completely cloud based so there is nothing to worry about. It's always blistering fast and always available.


### Drupal

Up until recently our least expensive Drupal hosting package was $75/yr. It includes the following:

* Super fast Drupal hosting using a complicated stack of software (Nginx, Redis, PHP-FPM, APC, MariaDB, Aegir) and specialized (SSD/15K SAS Drives, dedicated RAM) servers.
* Daily, Weekly, Monthly backups of the database, code, and files.
* Access to modules and themes via FTP with TLS/SSL.
* Aegir management interface on request.

No domain name, no fancy DNS hosting or CDN. To keep your site safe we maintain firewalls and security software. To keep it fast we manage load balancers, front-end caches, PHP Opt-Code caches, along with performance optimized versions of PHP, MySQL.


#### Maintenance Costs

There is no maintenance cost for static sites since they easily utilize cloud infrastructure and do not require any server side code. Drupal on the other hand is a modular structure that combines 20-100 (or more) separate building blocks that can be updated or no longer maintained on any given day. This requires constant maintenance, supervision, and re-implementation of given features. At a bare minimum sites will need to occasionally updated to keep up with the changing landscape. While Drupal is comprised of building blocks that are often the same ones used on other sites the exact combination is almost always unique to a specific site. Maintenance and updates are necessary, complicated, and sometimes very expensive.

#### Managed Drupal

Our simple solution to the Drupal maintenance problem is to charge a fee per enabled module. Starting at just $1/mo per enabled module we'll keep your site happy. We find most sites start with about 15 enabled modules. This is in addition to regular hosting fees.

### Static CMS

What if you want all the benefits of static sites *and* a CMS that makes editing content easy? We are now offering static site generation in the cloud. No software to worry about, no passwords to remember. Just some simple text files, editable on your computer that are connected to various pages on your website through internet magic. Static CMS in the Cloud FTW!
